# The Solid Principles

The solid principles dramatically enhance the maintainnability of software.

Some of then are:

### Single Responsability Principle (SRP)

You should design the classes so that each has a single purpose.

### Open/Closes principle (OCP)

The closed part of the rule states that once a module has been developed and tested, the code should only be adjusted to correct bugs. The open part says that you should be able to extend existing code in order to introduce new functionality.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

### Interface Segregation Principle

Interface segregation principle states:

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency inversion principle states:

Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

This principle allows for decoupling.
