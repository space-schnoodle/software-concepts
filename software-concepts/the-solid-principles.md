# The Solid Principles

The solid principles dramatically enhance the maintainnability of software.

Some of then are:

### Single Responsability Principle (SRP)

You should design the classes so that each has a single purpose.

### Open/Closes principle (OCP)

The closed part of the rule states that once a module has been developed and tested, the code should only be adjusted to correct bugs. The open part says that you should be able to extend existing code in order to introduce new functionality.
