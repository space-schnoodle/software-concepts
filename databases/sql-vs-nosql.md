# SQL vs NoSQL

## SQL

- data uses schemas
- Relations!
- Data is distributed across multiple tables.
- Horizontal scaling is difficult/imposible
- Vertical scaling is possible
- Limitations for lots of thousands read write queries per second.

## NoSQL

- Schema-less
- No (or very few) relationships.
- Data is tipically merged /mested in a few collections.
- Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible.
- Grate performance for mass read and write requests.
