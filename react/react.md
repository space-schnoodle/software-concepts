# React

## Converting HTML to JSX

- All prop names follow camelCase
- Number attributes use cursy braces
- Boolean 'true' can be written with just the property name. 'false' should be written with curly braces.
- The 'class' attribute is written as 'className'
- In JSX, in-line styles are provided as objects

### Notes

- Default exports can be renamed in the importing file!

#### Named Exports Statements

- Use when exporting multiple variables
- Can have as many named exports as we want
- Two ways to write a named export
