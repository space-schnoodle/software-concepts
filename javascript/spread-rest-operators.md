# Spread and rest operators

To pull elements or properties out of arrays and objects then it would be the `spread` operator.  
To merge multiple arguments into an array then its the `rest` operator.

**Example rest operator**

```js
const toArray = (...args) = > {

}
```

**Example spread operator**

slice() copies and array another way with the rest operator is

```js
const arrayCopy = [...array];

// Objects can also be copied

const person = {};
const copiedPerson = { ...person };
```
